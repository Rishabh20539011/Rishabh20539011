## Projects:
-[**Use of Ensemble Machine LearningModels to Reduce Fatalities in Aviation Industry**](https://jovian.ai/dwivedi-rishabh95/use-of-ensemble-modelling-to-reduce-fatalities-in-aviation-industry)
 
   Training 4.9 million and Testing 19 million rows of datasets from Kaggle Competition with different ensemble modeling techniques 
   such as RandomForest, LightGBM, Xgboost. This multi-class classification data with tuned RandomForest Classifier lands us on the 
   Top 26% of the Kaggle leaderboard.   
   
-[Exploratory Data Analysis on Air Quality in Indian Cities and how it affected during Covid-19 Lockdown ](https://jovian.ai/dwivedi-rishabh95/analysis-on-quality-of-air-and-how-it-affected-during-lockdown)

   Data Collected from Kaggle, CPCB & GDB Compare's website having 50K rows and 16 Columns. 
   Data Visualization helps us to describe the severity of Air pollution.
   Various factors such as location, time, population, literacy rate, Covid-19 Lockdown, etc. are taken in to consideration
   
-[Scraping Data from GRABCAD under various categories using Selenium](https://jovian.ai/dwivedi-rishabh95/project-web-scraping-with-python)

  Extracted most popular 3D cad models under various categories from the GRABCAD website using Selenium. 
  Extensive use of x_path, CSS selectors, functions, lists, dictionaries, etc. are used.
